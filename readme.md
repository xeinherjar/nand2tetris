## Nand2Tetris Homework


Currently taking [part 2](https://www.coursera.org/learn/nand2tetris2) on
Coursera.


In part 1 of the course you go through the process of building a virtual
computer.  You start with NAND gates, build other logic chips, adders,
flip flops, etc until you build a computer.


In part 2 of the course you build the software portion of the machine.
You start with the VM, then build a compiler, an operating system and some
games.


Part 2 for Coursera covers Chapters 04, 07 - 12

Chapters
*  [x] Chapter 4 Machine Language (Optional)
*  [x] Chapter 07 Virtual Machine 1 : Stack Arithmetic
*  [x] Chapter 08 Virtual Machine 2: Program Control
*  [x] Chapter 09 High-Level Languages
*  [ ] Chapter 10
*  [ ] Chapter 11
*  [ ] Chapter 12


Status: The application can compile VM code to assembly. The lexing and parsing
of the Jack language happen in later chapters.


TODO: I have found that with complex applications, such as the snake game I
built for chapter 9, that the VMWriter appears to have issues with some
applications.  This needs to be resolved.
