## Nand2Tetris Homework


Currently taking [part 2](https://www.coursera.org/learn/nand2tetris2) on
Coursera.


In part 1 of the course you go through the process of building a virtual
computer.  You start with NAND gates, build other logic chips, adders,
flip flops, etc until you build a computer.


In part 2 of the course you build the software portion of the machine.
You start with the VM, then build a compiler, an operating system and some
games.


I am using Python for this course, I am a JavaScript programmer by day, so
if the Python code isn't Pythonic I apologize.
